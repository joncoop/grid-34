- 0.8.0 Add 'sticky' features for header and footer elements

- 0.9.2 General code cleanup, clean up color palette, minor styling tweaks
- 0.9.3 Document the CSS really nicely, fix page titles in docs
- 1.0.0 Release unminimized in src folder, minimized in dist

### for v1.1
- Create row-10 class and corresponding col classes to have rows based on 10ths.
- Add containers that snap to widths according to viewport

### more ideas (not to include in css, just write instructions)
- Icon fonts
- Image carousels (owl-carousel)
- Add default code styling, syntax highlighting

### for fun
- Make the docs much prettier
- Work on themes
