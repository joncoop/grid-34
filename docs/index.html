<p>Odin was built with the intention of getting some insight into how some of the major grid frameworks (Bootstrap, Skeleton, Materialize, Pure, and so on) are built. I hope it is also useful for a new web developer looking to get a feel for how grid-based layouts work and to get new developers used to reading technical documentation. Hopefully, the somewhat simplified markup and less full-featured framework will be easy to use and learn from.</p>

<p>The grid is based entirely on flexbox and there are no browser prefixes or CSS 'hacks' used. Also, no effort has been made to ensure backwards-compatiblity with older browsers. <em>This is intentional</em>. I want the source code to illustrate major concepts behind CSS layout without getting lost among browser-specific workarounds. It works pretty darn well with Chrome, has a bug or two in Firefox, and is a bit of a mess in anything other than the absolute latest version of IE.</p>

<p>Many components associated with other frameworks such as carousels, cards, collapsible menus, etc. are not included. Perhaps at some point, more CSS modules will be added to implement extra features. Or maybe not. If extra functionality is needed, there are plenty of third-party CSS/JS options out there that should be pretty easy to integrate into this framework.</p>

<p>Be aware that <code>border-box</code> is the default <code>box-sizing</code> for all elements. If custom styling requires <code>content-box</code>, then you'll need to override this for those elements.</p>

<p>So why is it called Odin? The framework is based on 12 columns, so I looked at the Wikipedia article for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_(number)">12</a> and saw the entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin">Odin</a>. He seems like a pretty cool guy to name a framework after. Plus he has a pretty epic beard. So here we are.</p>
