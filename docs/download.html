<h2>Download</h2>

<p>The repository contains a <code>dist</code> folder which has the files you need to get started. The framework is defined entirely in <code>odin.css</code>. The <code>main.css</code> file just contains a somewhat organized template for adding any custom CSS. It is not a part of the framework. <a href="https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css">Normalize</a> is useful, but not required. It is included in the repository for convenience.</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    dist/
    ├── css/
    │   ├── main.css
    │   ├── normalize.css
    │   └── odin.css
    └── index.html
  </code>
</pre>

<p>The fastest way to get started is simply to copy the <code>dist</code> folder and start working.</p>

<p>If you are integrating Odin into an existing project, then copy <code>odin.css</code> into your project directory. Any resets such as <code>normalize.css</code> should be linked before <code>odin.css</code>. Custom stylesheets should be linked last.</p>

<p>Only the responsive navbar element requires odin.js and it is dependent on JQuery (not included). Hopefully, a future version will remove the JQuery dependency.</p>
