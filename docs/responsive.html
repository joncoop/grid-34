<h2>Default responsive elements</h2>

<p>The elements <code>img</code>, <code>iframe</code>, and <code>video</code> are given a max-width of 100% by default so that they will not overflow their containers. It is not necessary to apply any extra classes to make these elements responsive.</p>

<h2>Hiding content</h2>

<p>The following helper classes are provided to content on a given viewport size and down along with a given viewport size and up: <code class="important">hide-xs-down</code>, <code class="important">hide-sm-down</code>, <code class="important">hide-md-down</code>, <code class="important">hide-sm-up</code>, <code class="important">hide-md-up</code>, and <code class="important">hide-lg-up</code>. They can be applied to any element. Usage should be fairly obvious. Resize the browser window as you view the sentences below to see a demonstration.</p>

<p>
<span class="hide-xs-down">This sentence is visible on the viewports: sm, md, lg.<br></span>
<span class="hide-sm-down">This sentence is visible on the viewports: md, lg.<br></span>
<span class="hide-md-down">This sentence is visible on the viewports: lg.<br></span>
<span class="hide-sm-up">This sentence is visible on the viewports: xs.<br></span>
<span class="hide-md-up">This sentence is visible on the viewports: xs, sm.<br></span>
<span class="hide-lg-up">This sentence is visible on the viewports: xs, sm, md.</span>
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    &lt;p class="<span class="important">hide-xs-down</span>"&gt;This sentence is visible on the viewports: sm, md, lg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="<span class="important">hide-sm-down</span>"&gt;This sentence is visible on the viewports: md, lg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="<span class="important">hide-md-down</span>"&gt;This sentence is visible on the viewports: lg.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="<span class="important">hide-sm-up</span>"&gt;This sentence is visible on the viewports: xs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="<span class="important">hide-md-up</span>"&gt;This sentence is visible on the viewports: xs, sm&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="<span class="important">hide-lg-up</span>"&gt;This sentence is visible on the viewports: xs, sm, md.&lt;/p&gt;
  </code>
</pre>

<p>You can combine classes to show content on a specific range of viewports.<p>

<p class="hide-xs-down hide-lg-up">This sentence is visible on the following viewports: sm, md.</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    &lt;p class="<span class="important">hide-xs-down hide-lg-up</span>"&gt;This sentence is visible on the viewports: sm, md.&lt;/p&gt;
  </code>
</pre>

<p>There are no classes to show content on specific viewports. You'll also need to write custom classes if you want to hide or show content on a non-contiguous range of viewports.</p>
